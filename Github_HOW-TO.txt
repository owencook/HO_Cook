Go to Github and set up a new repository, include a README.md

Come back to your working directory and;

# git clone https://github.com/owencook/HO_Cook.git
# cd HO_Cook
 
# git remote set-url origin git@github.com:owencook/HO_Cook.git
 Change the README.md file for testing the next step

# git add README.md 
# git commit -m "Modified README"
# git push origin HEAD:master

If all goes well, the revised README.md will be uploaded to github. Then add say a new file;

# git add Jottings.txt 

# git commit -m "Initial" Jottings.txt 
# git push origin HEAD:master


The new file should have been added on github.
