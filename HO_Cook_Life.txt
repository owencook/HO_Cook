The Kapunda was a British emigrant ship and on 23 Jun 1878 it berthed at Rockhampton. Among the passengers were John Cook and Ada Annie Fry. They were to marry on the 11th October 1880 and from this union, there were five children born, one of which was Harold Owen Cook (Owen), born on the  9th of June 1885 at Neerkol, in the Stanwell district of Central Queensland.

Owen's father was killed during the 1891 shears strike, and a few months after this, Annie married Thomas Evans and the family moved to Wycarbah where he no doubt undertook his education.

The next record of Owen comes from a 1908 news item. Page 2 of the Chronicle and North Coast Advertiser (Qld. : 1903 - 1922), Saturday 12 January 1907, reads, "Owen Cook, a cane-cutter at North Eton (Q). backed  himself for Â£10 aside with a prominent Marian farmer to cut and load six tons of cane in eleven hours. The exhibition was made in a field of untrashed Cheribon cane in the presence of quite a number ot spectators. Cook succeeded in cutting and loading 7 tons 5cwt. 2qrs. in nine hours and three-quarters."

Marriage with a Nellie Hutchinson Crisfield occured on the 15th June 1912. Nellie who came from Withersfield, was a QR telegraphist, a calling she maintained till left QR. Owen at the time was a raileay guard so one can only guess that the railways brought them together.
